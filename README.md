## Introduction

The Gesture-Based User Interface Control System is an innovative and intuitive way to interact with digital devices using natural gestures and movements. This system enables users to control applications, devices, and interfaces seamlessly through eye movement, hand gestures, and body movements. It provides a more immersive and accessible user experience, making it ideal for various applications, including gaming, accessibility tools, and hands-free control.

## Features

- Intuitive and natural user interaction.
- Increased accessibility for users with mobility challenges.
- Enhanced gaming experiences.
- Improved user engagement and immersion.
- Customizable gestures and controls.
- Real-time tracking and responsiveness.

## Modules

### Eye Movement Control

The Eye Movement Control module allows users to interact with digital interfaces by tracking their eye movements. This technology enables hands-free navigation and control, making it ideal for applications where precise control is required without physical touch.

Key features:
- Eye tracking for cursor control.
- Blink detection for user actions.
- Customizable eye gesture recognition.

### Hand Gesture Control

The Hand Gesture Control module enables users to control digital devices using hand gestures. It uses advanced computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret a wide range of hand movements and gestures, providing an intuitive and immersive user experience.

Key features:
- Hand gesture recognition for navigation and control.
- Gestures for selecting, zooming, and scrolling.
- Support for multiple hand tracking and gestures.

### Body Movement Control

The Body Movement Control module allows users to interact with digital interfaces through body movements. It utilizes depth-sensing cameras to track the user's body and interpret their movements, providing a truly immersive and engaging experience.

Key features:
- Full-body tracking for controlling avatars or characters.
- Gesture-based commands for in-app actions.
- Real-time feedback and responsiveness.
